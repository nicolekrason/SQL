#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT count(orderID) as "Number of orders placed in January"
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderID) as "Number of iPhone orders in January"
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM bit_db.FebSales feb

INNER JOIN bit_db.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id

WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product, min(price)
FROM bit_db.JanSales;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity) * price as revenue, product
FROM bit_db.jansales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(Quantity) as quantity, product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
